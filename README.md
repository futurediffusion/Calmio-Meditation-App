# Calmio Meditation App

Prototype breathing exercise built with **PySide6**. The minimalist interface features a textured breathing circle that gently inflates and deflates. The circle shifts to a calm green hue when idle, and a small menu button offers additional options.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PySide6

Install dependencies in a virtual environment with the provided batch script.

## Usage

On Windows:

```bat
run_app.bat
```

The script creates a `venv` folder if missing, installs dependencies, pulls the latest code, and runs the app.

On other systems, manually create a virtual environment and run `python main.py`.
